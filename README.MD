## Prerequisites
A node project with [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) used for database.

## Install
It can be installed using npm.

```
npm install mysql-migrations --save-dev
```

## Setup
1. Create a directory where you wish to maintain all your migrations.
2. Instantiate mysql-migrations by passing a mysql pool. Also mention the migrations directory.

```
# migration.js
var mysql = require('mysql');
var migration = require('mysql-migration');

var connection = mysql.createPool({
  connectionLimit : 10,
  host     : 'localhost',
  user     : 'root',
  password : 'password',
  database : 'your_database'
});

migration.init(connection, __dirname + '/migrations');
```

### If you already have a build process for your project like Gulp or Shipit
```
var migration = require('mysql-migrations');\
migration.init(mysqlConnection,migrationsPath);
```


## Adding Migrations
Migrations can be added in two ways. 

> Replace {{migration_name}} at will.

1. Run `node migration.js add migration {{migration_name}}`. Now open the migrations folder. Locate the newest file with greatest timestamp as it predecessor. Write the query in `up` key of the json created. As a part of good practice, also write the script to undo the migration in `down` key.
2. Run `node migration.js add seed {{migration_name}}` to add a seed.
3. Run `node migration.js add migration {{migration_name}} "CREATE TABLE mysql_migrations_347ertt3e (user_id INT NOT NULL, UNIQUE KEY user_id (user_id) )"`. Locate the newest file with greatest timestamp as it predecessor and open it. Query will be automatically added as `up` key. However `down` key needs to be filled manually.
4. You may create the migration file and add a function.
```
module.exports = {
  'up' :  function (conn, cb) {
    conn.query ("UPDATE users set name = 'alen'", function (err, res) {
      cb();
    });
  },
  'down' : ""
}
```

## Executing Migrations
There are few ways to run migrations.

1. Run `node migration.js up`. Runs all the pending `up` migrations.
2. Run `node migration.js up 2`. Runs 2 pending `up` migrations from the last position.
3. Run `node migration.js down`. Runs only 1 `down` migrations.
4. Run `node migration.js refresh`. Runs all down migrations followed by all up.

## TODO:
Allow table alters as well as table creation

## Help and Support
Will be more than happy to improve upon this version. This is an over night build and needs to be improved certainly. Will welcome everyone who wants to contribute.

## Credits and other stuff
It is my first contribution to npm and I am sort of happy over it. I made this when I was really looking for a suitable tool with barebone settings allowing me to maintain database structure. I could not find a basic one and hence wrote my own and finally decided to publish. It took me around 2 hours to write the first version which barely works. But it still does my job.
